# StatLab
This repository serves as a statistics study lab, bringing together summaries, notes, and conceptual experiments. Although it doesn’t follow a formal pedagogical structure, it was designed to help with quick and practical reviews of statistical concepts.

It is not a course or instructional guide, but rather a personal space for exploration and idea organization — useful for those who are already somewhat familiar with the topics and want to revisit them in a concise and direct way.
